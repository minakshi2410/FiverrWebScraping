I couldnt give him a higher rating as there isnt one! truely excellent service that I'd love to use again depending on his thoughts. Its no wonder hes fiverrs top rated seller for data scrapping. 100 stars!!"
cmariushall,United States,5,"I've been working with scrapers for 20 years and Fiverr's for at least 10. This is one of the best experiences I've had. Ultra_Scrape knows how to communicate, understand the desired outcome, and deliver a quality product. In fact, he/they went above and beyond, clearly spending time ensuring the data was perfect before delivering it. I highly recommend Ultra_Scrape and will be using this service again."
markherod,Canada,5,I asked for a website to be scraped of emails and phone numbers.     This was done in a few hours and I am VERY impressed with the level of complexity and how fast this  was done. If you ever need someone to gather info from a website this is the person to use !!
physiogear,Australia,5,This was very simple. The seller knows his work and was able to suggest options that made it simple to decide. I am using this information to establish accuracy before contacting him again to build the volume.
peachnogo,United States,5,Got extremely detailed data within a very reasonable time window.  He delivered on everything he said and made revisions quickly.  No one else said they could scrape what he scraped.  I will definitely use him again next time I need scraping.

kag123,United States,5,"I sent shafaqat048 information my project and he responded very quickly with both a solid understanding of what I was attempting to do and how to do it. While he stated he would need 2 days, he completed the project with a few hours. I would highly recommend him for your data mining project.  He did an excellent job.  I already have project #2 lined up for him."
kag123,United States,5,"It is a pleasure to work with Shafaqat048 and his team. This is my second order with him and very pleased. He provided exactly what I requested and completed the order very quickly. I can recommend him without reservation in the area of web scraping, excel and data mining. His expertise and delivery is well worth the cost of the order."
cmariushall,United States,5,"Seller did a perfect job. We probably should have communicated more about the details ahead of time so that we both understood what was being asked. However, this did not slow down the job and the result was just as expected."
blaxxun89,Germany,5,"Absolutely great experience. Quality of the data was perfect, communication was direct and professional. Will for sure work with Shafaqat again for web scraping and data mining projects. Thanks a lot for your help. :-)"
markusespeter,Belgium,5,"Adeel was very responsive and delivered excellent work on my request within ten hours upon a special agreed price which was very fair and affordable for the work done. For the price paid I received almost 400 contacts including email and contact number from a website that was scraped. Awesome!

I had one request to make a change in the data which was dealt with immediately.

I can recommend Adeel 100% and will order again for my next request within this area."
twan_ai_venture,Switzerland,2.3,"Seller generally does a good job and is responsive, but for this task he missed one (critical) aspect, which was clearly listed as a deliverable and without any communication until we started querying why it was missing from the delivered set. In the end he would/could not deliver it, so we're left with a half-solution. A pity as in other respects the work was good."
thomatkinson,United Kingdom,4,"Adeel, was fast, reliable and delivered what was asked. There were some issues with scope of service but these were largely due to my not defining my scope of services tightly enough. Adeel delivered what was requested but made some assumptions that meant the product wasn't quite as expected."
brandonocampo,United States,5,First time working with this seller. Received delivery earlier than expected and it was perfect! I was expecting to have to work through revisions but that wasn't the case. Everything was perfect! I'll be using this seller every time! Extremely satisfied with the results. Thank you!
dillonwalton10,United States,5,"Amazing work, was completed very early and with perfection. Very satisfied and will come back to this seller time and time again."
mscheerer,United States,5,"Wow, I can't thank you enough. This was an urgent and critical task that I needed to get done but had no ability to do so. Even the organization who runs the platform was unable to help me and I would have had to do everything manually. Can't speak highly enough of you, your ability to get what I needed done, your communication, and responsiveness. Will definitely be back for anything else that comes up."
bigriodog,United States,5,"SUPER FANTASTIC!
I can't express in simple words the job outstanding job mdysaul has done for us.  The work was complicated and he resolved all the problems to a point of excellence. 
He went so far as to make a video for me on how to easily use his work. (I need all the help I can get as I'm 73 years old and not the IT literate)
His grammar and English is also a 10 out of 10.  
If you need a problem solver, that's professional and quick...He's your man.

cameronkotara,United States,5,Mdyasul was very skilled and persistent with a very demanding request related to data mining and scraping.

donaldbriann,United States,5,"You guys are geniuses! When we first engaged Wajahat, we didn’t have any software at all, just some ideas. Before the team even wrote a single line of code for the platform, we went through discovery, design, and planning process. The team spent hours interviewing fitness coaches around the world, asking them about their challenges. They used what they learned to make recommendations to us in terms of the platform and what it should encompass.

The services Malek Tech provided covered ideation and design, all the way through to the actual development work. From there, they went on to maintaining and supporting the platform to where it is today. Highly recommend working with them!"
lisadrake69,Australia,5,Absolutely amazing! The app turned out to be really beautiful. The Malek team are super friendly and their experience makes it really a worthwhile experience. I love that I received a premium app for the price. It’s definitely not like other expensive sellers and you only get a knock off quality app. I am definitely returning to buy more apps. Great work Wajahat! Keep it up.
facgavhagacw,Canada,5,"Do yourself a favor and hire these guys already. The service is unmatched. Wajahat truly cares about your experience. The end product is absolutely amazing – every change I suggested was promptly applied. Absolutely the best service we had on Fiverr. I have to say, I enjoyed each step of the process. Ideal for those who want a spectacular app but don’t exactly know where and how to start. Highly recommend!"
jonsonlaura,Australia,5,"Awesome job!
Legitimately the best seller on this platform. Really shaped up the app to my complete satisfaction. My partner and I have been buying gigs on Fiverr for a few years now but this has been my best experience so far! They make the most premium apps and the quality they put in each app is outstanding. Really reflects their expertise. Wajahat is a professional and his honesty brought me to buy from him and now I won’t go anywhere but these guys because they’re the complete package! Awesome job guys. Keep up the great work. Looking forward to future projects!"
henre_alifre6,United States,5,Outstanding communication! Brilliant designing skills. Really cared about the slightest details and aesthetics of the design.

He always replied within the hour when he was awake and has immense knowledge in the field."
